1.How many threads (in total) are created during the execution of the program?
We are creating one thread, "tid" during execution of the program, because on line 25 we call pthread_create() and pass the thread as argument. (the name of the thread is specified in pthread_create:  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/multithreading-c-2/)
To create multiple threads, we could put the pthread_create() in a for loop for n amount of iterations. 

2.What are lines 16, 17, 20, 25and 26intended for?
16 : declares a variable "tid" of type pthread_t
17: declares a variable "attr" of type pthread_attr_t. used to change behavior in thread
20: This function initializes the thread attribute (https://users.cs.cf.ac.uk/Dave.Marshall/C/node30.html)
25: creates a thread called "tid".The function takes 4 arguments, where the first is a pointer to the thread id "tid", 2nd is specifying attribtues, 3rd is the name of function to 
be executed in order for the thread to be created, 4th passes arguments to the function in our 3rd argument. 

3.How many parameters are passed to function runner?


4.How can function runner know the values for parameters that, such as max value, not arepassed to it?
5.Test how the behavior of the program changesif line 26is omitted. Explain why.
